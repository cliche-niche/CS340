This repository contains the programming assignments we had to submit in the course CS340: Theory of Computation (2022-23 I Sem.) in a team of three. <br>
4 assignments were planned but only 2 were released :^)

+ [Assignment 1](./Assignment1.pdf): This assignment contained 16 questions, each worth 10 marks, based on topics pertaining to Finite automatas, Regular languages, Regular Expressions, etc. <br> 3 marks were deducted in the second question with the remark
  > Explanation needed.
  
  We had asked for an elaboration, but it was never given.
Our solutions were awarded 157 marks, with 3 marks deducted in Q2 with the feedback "Explanation needed."
+ [Assignment 2](./Assignment2.pdf): This assignment contained 6 questions (marks breakdown: 10+20,20, 20, 20, 20, 10), based majorly on Turing Machines, and had some questions on finite/ pushdown automata and regular languages/ CFLs. <br> Full marks were awarded.
