This repository contains the programming assignments we had to submit in the course CS340: Theory of Computation (2022-23 I Sem.) in a team of three. <br>
4 assignments were planned but only 2 were released :^)

+ [Assignment 1](./Assignment1.pdf): This assignment contained 16 questions, each worth 10 marks, based on topics pertaining to Finite automatas, Regular languages, Regular Expressions, etc. <br> 3 marks were deducted in the second question with the remark:
  > Explanation needed.

  We had asked for an elaboration, but it was never given.

+ [Assignment 2](./Assignment2.pdf): This assignment contained 6 questions (marks breakdown: 10+20,20, 20, 20, 20, 10), based majorly on Turing Machines, and had some questions on finite/ pushdown automata and regular languages/ CFLs. <br> Full marks were awarded.

+ [Notes](./Notes.pdf): These are the notes I made (primarily) from Prof. Manindra Agrawal's lectures. Other important sources include Dexter Kozen's "Automata and Computability" (DFAs, NFAs, and PDAs), Michael Sipser's "Introduction To The Theory Of Computation" (TMs and Computability Theory), and Raghunath Tewari's [lecture notes](https://ict.iitk.ac.in/cs340-theory-of-computation-module01/) (TMs, Computability Theory, and Complexity Theory).
